# Final Project: Data Mining and Data Warehouses

## Project Description

This final project for the course "Data Mining and Data Warehouses" comprised three main assignments, each focusing on different aspects of data management and analysis. The projects involved designing a relational database, writing complex SQL queries, and creating a data warehouse schema to support analytical operations.

### Project 1: Relational Database Design for the National Library
- **Objective:** Design a relational database for the National Library to efficiently manage and organize vast amounts of information related to books, authors, customers, employees, and transactions.
- **Tasks:**
  - Developed an Entity-Relationship (E/R) diagram to model the library's database structure.
  - Created SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) commands to implement the relational schema based on the E/R diagram.
  - Ensured the database design supported tracking of book rentals, employee roles, and publisher information.
  
### Project 2: Advanced SQL Queries for Analytical Insights
- **Objective:** Write advanced SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from a given relational database schema that includes information about countries, populations, economies, and languages.
- **Tasks:**
  - Developed SQL queries to analyze demographic, economic, and linguistic data.
  - Implemented complex queries to identify trends such as dominant languages, poverty rates, population decline, and GDP changes.
  - Ensured queries were optimized for performance and correctness, providing valuable insights for data-driven decision-making.

### Project 3: Data Mart Design for Hotel Chain Analytics
- **Objective:** Design a data mart to enable a hotel chain to analyze room reservations, focusing on metrics such as reservation counts and income generated.
- **Tasks:**
  - Created a Dimensional Fact Schema using the attribute tree methodology to support analytical queries.
  - Designed the data mart to provide insights at various granularity levels, including date, room size, hotel location, and customer region.
  - Applied data warehouse concepts to ensure the schema facilitated efficient aggregation and drill-down analysis.

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Database Design:** Entity-Relationship (E/R) diagrams, SQL DDL
- **Data Analysis:** Advanced SQL querying, data aggregation, and analysis
- **Data Warehousing:** Dimensional Fact Schema design, attribute tree methodology
- **Tools:** PostgreSQL, SQL, data modeling tools (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart)
